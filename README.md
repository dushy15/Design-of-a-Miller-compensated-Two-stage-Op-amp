# Design-of-a-Miller-compensated-Two-stage-Op-amp
 Implemented a two-stage op-amp with differential input and single-ended output using nMOS input pairs.
Achieved closed loop 3dB bandwidth of 36.6MHz, DC loop gain of 63dB, phase margin of 74.04◦, with the load capacitance  of 5pF and load Resistance of 20 kΩ.
